In my 1st html task, I created an HTML page that contains a sign-up form with input fields for Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password.
Each field uses the correct input type (text, email, password). I also added a Submit button at the end of the form.The structure is made using the <form> tag, and each input field is labeled properly using <label>.

In my 2nd task, I created a div container that acts as a card.Inside the div, I placed a short paragraph describing some text.And used some css styles to style the sheet

In my 3rd task,i designed an HTML page with a heading, a paragraph, one image, and three links.I applied CSS styling to make the page visually neat and centered.The background is set to black, and all text is white for better contrast.I used the <img> tag for the image and added a hover effect to the links using CSS
